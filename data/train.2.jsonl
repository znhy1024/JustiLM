If you take the narrowest definition of \"sign-ups,\" there would have to be 3.3 million cancellations in the state for Paul\u2019s statement to be accurate -- and there aren\u2019t even that many Kentuckians with private insurance plans that could theoretically be canceled. In fact, it\u2019s reasonable to argue that more people in Kentucky have coverage through Obamacare than have been canceled. Paul\u2019s statement is so wildly off that we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, May 6, 2014: After we published this item, Paul\u2019s office contacted us to explain how they calculated the 40-to-1 ratio of cancellations to signups. The office said that \"the numbers he used were accurate as of November of last year\" but that staffers failed \"to update the numbers for the newsletter.\" Specifically, Paul\u2019s office said that a Nov. 8, 2013, news release from the Kentucky governor\u2019s office reported that 7,011 Kentuckians had enrolled in a private health plan through Nov. 8, compared to the 280,000 Kentuckians who the state believed at the time might be subject to cancellation notices. However, in the six months since, the number of private-plan signups has soared by a factor of 10, while the state released a smaller estimate of cancellation notices (168,000). Even in November, Paul\u2019s estimate was cherry-picked; it excluded the 33,561 Kentuckians who enrolled in Medicaid, a program that saw its eligibility expanded under Obamacare. Even though the new numbers were available to Paul\u2019s staff at the time the newsletter was put together, Paul\u2019s office counted only the first two months of signups and ignored the final six months, a period when enrollment rose steadily. stands: Pants on Fire."}
