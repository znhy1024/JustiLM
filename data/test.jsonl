To his credit, during his interview, Rubio did state that the cuts would be spread out over the next 10 years, instead of making it seem like the money would come out of the current-year budget. However, Rubio still identifies those who voted for the federal health care law as those who voted to \"cut Medicare,\" without noting that spending on the program is still expected to increase. The vote taken by Congress was not to cut Medicare but to reduce the rate of growth by $500 billion by targeting inefficiencies in the program. That's a cost-reduction plan that Ryan himself kept intact in his own budget proposal. Republicans, meanwhile, voted for a budget plan that envisions spending less on Medicare in the future to restore fiscal balance to the federal budget and reduce the deficit. Both parties have voted -- at different times and on different proposals -- to reduce future spending for Medicare. We rate Rubio\u2019s claim Barely True.

Obama's deficit reduction plan is much more specific than Romney's, but for a sitting president, that's expected. Still, independent analysts say that Romney's plan is so vague that it's difficult to know how his plan will impact the federal budget. What are missing are the politically sensitive details on which programs he would cut and which tax breaks he would reduce. What we do know indicates his plan could drive up deficits, potentially a great deal. The Obama plan offers enough details to estimate its impact with more accuracy. Independent analysts estimate savings of about $2.4 trillion over ten years due solely to his proposal. Obama\u2019s plan on its own does not produce the full $4 trillion. Plus, estimates over 10 years are always uncertain and some analysts caution that achieving the $4 trillion goal by itself does less to solve the deficit problem than the president suggests.

He also used 2015 data, when 2016 data is available from various sources. But his central point \u2014 that there is an observable difference between what black workers and white workers make \u2014 is supported by the data.

But blasphemy laws remain on the books in Muslim nations, and the largest international body that speaks for those nations has said plainly that such laws are appropriate and ought to be adopted in the west. Not even Turley argues that this is the result the administration wanted, and another critic of the administration's strategy said American diplomats do not support efforts to establish an international blasphemy standard.

That doesn\u2019t mean a private seller determined to get a background check is out in the cold. He can ask a gun dealer to conduct the check for him. But that\u2019s a messy process that requires a lot of paperwork and the private seller to temporarily convey his gun to the dealer.

We have checked that claim before, when Kean made a similar statement in a 2011 news release. Back then Kean mentioned only tax increases, but there were quite a few fee increases, too.

But a different statistic that takes into account population growth, the participation rate, is indeed lower now than it\u2019s been since 1979. It\u2019s important to note that a significant portion of this decline comes from the aging of the baby boomers, rather than economic weakness. On balance, we rate her statement Half True."}

But the statement is misleading. The CBO projected the law will lead to 2.5 million fewer full time equivalent workers by 2024, but the report does not say that those legions will \"lose their jobs.\" That implies the employees will be laid off or forced out of work. To the contrary, the report takes pains to note that virtually all of those people will be working less due to their own choices, such as opting to receive higher federal subsidies for care rather than working more to boost their wages. The CBO said it\u2019s not projecting the law would cause a bump in unemployment or underemployment. The report does not paint a rosy picture of the economy and it can be easy to miss the distinction between people leaving jobs because they want to as opposed to being laid off.

Meanwhile, it\u2019s plausible that the Romney plan could provide less of a \"guarantee\" than Medicare currently does, but we found sharp disagreement between supporters and opponents of Romney\u2019s Medicare plan on that point.

And so far, the company has only gotten $190 million in those loans, far less than the half a billion.

Given the implications for our housing market, we suspect most Floridians are sorry that his claim checks out. What's not so clear is Smith's suggestion that Florida Republicans are somehow responsible for the ailing housing market. While he doesn't explicitly blame Republicans for causing the housing bust, he does suggest it, and that's enough for us to downgrade his rating.

Faculty handbooks show that tenured faculty members can be dismissed for performance or financial reasons even if they have tenure and that they must undergo annual performance reviews. Further documents provided by the Board of Regents show that faculty have faced disciplinary action by their respective universities. Holt wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan that he was offering an opinion, based on reports he hears about the conduct some faculty have used to, in his words, silence students. He said he did not state his opinion about faculty feeling protected as fact and that his opinion cannot be proved either way.

But there are all kinds of holes in projecting the size and scope of the legislation's impact. * The basis for the governor's estimate assumed a future that did not come to pass. Specifically, the governor's estimates relied on future property values continuing to increase and local governments failing to lower their property tax rate. We now know property values are decreasing. * The governor's office admits its projections are now inaccurate because of declines in property values statewide. * A state analysis concluded that the tax measures have failed to produce the savings estimated by the governor. Portability, for instance, was predicted to cut taxable property values by $11.5 billion in 2008. But it cut property values only $3.4 billion, the analysis showed. Here's the bottom line: While the tax structure changes passed by the Legislature, signed by Crist and approved by voters undoubtedly will result in less property taxes being paid by Florida residents, the specific financial impact of the initiatives remains quite unclear. Experts say projections can be misleading. But given the decline in home values, we know Crist will have difficulty reaching his claim of $25 billion over five years. In the absence of additional data, and with the knowledge that Save Our Homes has cut property tax bills for Florida residents $32 billion or more, we can't agree with Crist that the 2007 and 2008 changes constitute the largest tax cut in state history.

California\u2019s 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas\u2019 pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful claim. But California\u2019s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas\u2019 1.6 job growth rate. Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California\u2019s GDP expanded faster than Texas\u2019 GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown\u2019s statement. Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years. Brown, like the state\u2019s economy in recent years, is on the right track. And while California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily \"a hell of a lot faster.\" We rate Brown\u2019s statement Mostly True.

But Ryan mixes apples and oranges, in that the $1 trillion is actually spent on far more people than the 46 million counted as living in poverty.

New York already prohibited charging higher premiums based on health status. PolitiFact looked at this more fully when examining a related claim about Faso. We are interested here in whether Faso was the deciding vote -- whether, as the ad suggests, he could have stopped it all. We need not go far to decide, because the same kind of claim was used by Republicans against Democrats in past elections, when Republicans blasted Democrats for passing the ACA in the first place. They noted how a procedural motion needed for the bill passed by a single vote. Here were some of those claims: Bill Nelson \"the deciding vote\" on the health care law (2012) Warner cast \"the tiebreaking vote\" on Obamacare (2013) Mark Udall 'passed Obamacare with his vote' (2014) Russ Feingold cast deciding vote on Obamacare (2015) There\u2019s more, but you get the gist. Faso was one of 19 House Budget Committee members who voted for the early version of the House repeal-and-replace bill last year. Had he voted no, things might have changed.
