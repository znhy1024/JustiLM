He\u2019s right. Innovations alone aren\u2019t enough to justify the extreme increases in price that have raised insulin costs over the years. PBMs, with their complicated discount negotiations; and manufacturers, with their continuing drive to increase earnings, both play a role. So do drug stores, pharmacies, and other suppliers who want to be competitive in the marketplace by offering consumers discounts. But the discounts don\u2019t go to everyone with diabetes, and when they do, they vary from vendor to vendor. Multiple studies in recent years, testimony in public hearings, the drug\u2019s pricing history, and sourcing in federal government reports show examples of complicated procedures related in large part to negotiated discounts for some vendors adding to overall insulin costs. We rate Grassley\u2019s statement True. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the acronym PBM stood for pharmacy business manager; it is pharmacy benefit manager."}

Durbin said of Chicago, \"You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city. They are just areas of devastation economically and otherwise.\" Durbin\u2019s office cited a news article that used statistics from the Chicago Police Department. A press release from CPD News Affairs Office confirms this. It read: \"Three districts (7, 11, 15) are responsible for approximately 50% of murders in January 2017.\" We confirmed these statistics by looking at data available on crime maps posted on the CPD Harrison, Englewood and Austin district websites. Durbin\u2019s assessment of Chicago\u2019s homicides is accurate. He did say you can \"almost\" attribute half of deaths to a few communities and 43 percent are in certain west and south side neighborhoods. A crime expert told us these trends have been consistent over the last five decades. Finally, we found data that shows there is a correlation between areas with high violence and economic hardship. For these reasons, we rate Durbin\u2019s claim True."}

{"id": "16374", "query": "\"4.7 million people have lost their insurance in 32 states\" due to Obamacare.", "target": "Loesch said that 4.7 million people have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare. That number matches one cited by the Associated Press based on preliminary estimates and incomplete data. The best estimate from independent researchers is that perhaps 2.6 million people received notices that their health care insurance policies were being canceled. However, Loesch spoke as if these people, whatever their number, did not find replacement coverage. In reality, fewer than 1 million people who had been part of the individual insurance market ended up with no coverage at all. Given the constant churn in that market, it is unlikely that the Affordable Care Act caused all of them to be without health insurance. Loesch\u2019s number is off, both in terms of the cancellations and what people did afterward. Still, the new law did hurt some people. We rate the claim Mostly False."}

We find that Mack\u2019s new wording could still leave voters with a false impression. Nelson did take some votes that raised taxes. But Mack grossly inflates the number by counting multiple votes on the same bill, non-binding resolutions and some fees that only affected a slice of the population. We rate this claim False."}

In Kansas, out of more than 850,000 votes cast, only 14 names were recommended for prosecution and the Kansas Secretary of State reported no convictions. In other states, database quirks, human error and the statistics of large numbers have been shown to trim the initial reports of widespread fraud down to the barest sliver of actual cases.
