Data from that report, and researchers who study poverty, support Mayes\u2019 statement. The state\u2019s 20.6 percent poverty rate is higher than any other, though Florida\u2019s 19 percent rate is close, especially when considering the margin of error. The supplemental report is considered by experts the best state-by-state measure of poverty, because it takes into account geographic differences in cost-of-living, not just income levels. In his statement, Mayes cited the specific report that backs his claim, and added the context that another report, one that doesn\u2019t account for cost-of-living, shows California\u2019s poverty closer to the national average. Given this clarity and context, we rate Mayes' statement True. TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.

The second statement was not a literal quote, and that\u2019s worth noting, but it was a true reflection of Romney's position. According to our Truth-O-Meter, this ad passes muster.

Rubio said he wanted Florida to cook up a plan of its own before federal regulations were imposed on the state. He also voiced opposition to government mandates and inserted a roadblock to letting any plan actually be implemented, details that get left out when Rubio is accused of supporting the measure. He now is much more vocal in his opposition of cap and trade, but it looks as if he has always favored a largely hands-off approach from government. We rate Rubio\u2019s statement Mostly True."}

COVID-19's spike protein was identified nearly 20 years ago as a potential vaccine target during the development of the SARS vaccine, following the 2003 SARS outbreak. This has helped expedite the vaccine process, given that vaccine platform technologies have advanced in recent years, as well. Another accelerant was the commercial-scale production of COVID-19 vaccine doses prior to FDA clearance, called at-risk manufacturing, when early results appeared promising. Finding suitable vaccine targets for HIV, cancer and the common cold has been more difficult in comparison as these diseases have either elusive or highly variable targets."}

But the state then increased the budget to about $2.7 million the next year and it has remained in that ballpark for four years. Scott also vetoed a one-time appropriation of $500,000 in 2011 for a mosquito lab at FAMU, and the university then shut it down.

But beyond that, the DCCC statement falls apart. The Ryan plan would not end Medicare for anyone. The government would continue to help all older Americans pay for their medical bills. And the plan would not mean any change in costs of services for 92 percent of the people who now receive Medicare. So the blanket statement that it would raise the cost for seniors is misleading. The fact that 8 percent might see higher costs does not support the DCCC\u2019s blanket statement that health care costs will rise for seniors. For younger Americans, there would still be a universal program that helps them pay for health care when they reach retirement age through payments to help buy private insurance. They would face higher out-of-pocket costs than those insured under the current plan. The DCCC knows this but seems intent on scaring seniors. We rate its claim False."}
